Freedom of speech is defined as the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint. It is a tool in nurturing social evolution that grants us a certain level of frankness or saying things in a very direct and honest way, improved trust and better sense of responsibility. sharing of ideas can also boost productivity level in workplaces and it promotes social relationship which is an evident benefit for us.
we should encourage free speech to help people enhance their confidence to express their ideas without fear of being criticized or punished. by encouring free speech, people fighting for what they believe is right can challenge the rules and laws, this people are usually leaders in economic development. but every right has its limitations so the government should set up laws to ensure individuals have the chance to express their ideas without discrimination or promoting offensive or biased ideas such as terrorism, sexism, fascism, and racism.
