		<p>Most of us loves traveling, and we think that it is one of 
            the hobbies of people who enjoys adventure and nature. 
            Some of us are afraid to move because they might break a 
            law but did you know that everyone has the right to go 
            anywhere they want. We have the freedom to go from one place 
            to another. We can work from one office to another. We can 
            live anywhere we want. No one can stop us from moving from one 
            place to another because it is our right as a citizen. So let's 
            go out and enjoy our right and freedom of movement.

		  <p>Information, it is the answer to the question of some kind. It is related to data and knowledge. 
		   It signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. Information is important.

		   the information act is to empower the citizens and strengthen the community to know more about what are the activities 
		   does the Government planning to do. It gives citizens the access to information laws including all information held by 
		   the government should be accessible. It aims to make more information available and provide equal information across with the community.
