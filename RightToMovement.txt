Most of us loves traveling, and we think that it is one of the hobbies of people who enjoys adventure
and nature. Some of us are afraid to move because they might break a law but did you know that everyone 
has the right to go anywhere they want. We have the freedom to go from one place to another. 
We can work from one office to another. We can live anywhere we want. No one can stop us from 
moving from one place to another because it is our right as a citizen. So let's go out and enjoy our
right and freedom of movement.
