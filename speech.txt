Freedom of speech is defined as the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint. It is a tool in nurturing social evolution that grants us a certain level of frankness, trust, liability and responsbility.
we should encourage free speech to help people enhance their confidence and to express their ideas without fear of being criticized or punished. sharing of ideas can also boost productivity level in workplaces. but every right has its limitations so the government should set up laws to ensure individuals have the chance to express their ideas without discrimination or promoting biased ideas such as terrorism, sexism, fascism, and racism.
